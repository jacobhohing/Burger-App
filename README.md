# Burger-App

This Project is designed to take showcase a Full Stack environment. A user can add Burger names to data base, view them once created, and modify their content.

- Displays Burgers that have yet to be eaten, and those have.
- Burgers that have not been consumed can be "Eaten" by clicking the button below that record.
- Once eaten, the burger will move to the far right column, indicating their 'devoured' status has changed. 
- Adding a burger in the input field and pressing 'Add Burger' will insert a burger record into the db.
